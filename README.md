# Introduction

Search image, video, document, application or anything, or even search on Google, Yahoo!, Bing or Duck Duck Go, your choise it. A page like the one you see everytime you open your browser, just looks better and give more options.

## How it works?

No need to for any unnecessary work, open the site type the query, select the search engine and file type or maybe not, its optional, and go explore the wast world of web.

### Direct Site

Site is hosted on github pages. Anyone can use it on the url https://theketan26.github.io/Browser-react-page/#

### React app

Anyone can access the react app also, just follow the following steps, 
1. Open the terminal, 
2. Run the command "git clone https://github.com/theketan26/Browser-start-page.git"
3. Run the command "cd Browser-start-page"
4. Run the command "npm init"
5. Run the command "npm install react react-router-dom react bootstrap react-bootstrap axios react-icons"
6. Run the command "npm start"

If everything work out correctly, the server will start on port 3000. 
You can access the server by opening the url in any browser.
URl: localhost:3000

## Make it personal permanent

You can make the page default start page and every time you start browser the page appear, just follow the steps.

For Firfox:
1. Open the browser,
2. Go to setting,
3. Search new window and tab,
4. Change the Custom url to "https://theketan26.github.io/Browser-react-page/#"
5. To change the for new tabs you'll need to add addon, I suggest "New tab override"
